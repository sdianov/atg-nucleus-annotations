# atg-annotations

Collection of Java annotations to allow configure Nucleus components without ".property" files.

Inspired by Spring annotations configuration.

The main idea is the annotation processors generate property files from annotation values and place these files into additional Nucleus config layer.

MANIFEST.MF file for your ATG module should look like this:

ATG-Config: /target/genconfig /config

Each module has two config layers: autogenerated layer (ignored in VCS) and ordinary layer for manual modifications.

**Annotation List:**

_NucleusComponent_ - exposes Java class as Nucleus component.

_NucleusInject_ - injects existing Nucleus component into class' property.

_NucleusValue_ - sets the property value for Nucleus component

**Example:**

**Usage**

Add atg-annotations.jar as a runtime dependency
Add atg-annotation-processors.jar as a compile-time dependency

Also set java parameter "-Aatggen" pointing to folder where to place generated config files.
